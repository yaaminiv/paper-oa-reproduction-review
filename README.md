# Ocean acidification does not overlook sex: Review of understudied effects and implications of low pH on marine invertebrate sexual reproduction

*Link to manuscript coming soon*

## Abstract

Sexual reproduction is a fundamental process essential for species persistence, evolution, and diversity. However, unprecedented oceanographic shifts due to climate change and anthropogenic effects can impact physiological processes with important implications for sexual reproduction. This article reviews how ocean acidification can impact sexual reproductive processes in marine invertebrates and highlights current research gaps. We focus on four economically and ecologically important taxonomic groups: cnidarians, crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs. We identify trends in reproductive performance in acidified conditions, discuss the spatial and temporal variability of experimental designs in the context of reproductive traits (gametogenesis, fertilization, and reproductive resource allocation), and provide a quantitative analysis of the published literature to assess the effects of low pH on fertilization rates across taxa. Our recommendations for future research will allow for better understanding of how reproduction in invertebrates will be affected in the context of a rapidly changing environment. Since models often consider the reproductive parameter as a “black box” and/or often overestimate it, our findings and suggestions will help to design and develop better tools to project future ecological trends in response to global change. We argue for increased focus on fundamental reproductive biology of marine invertebrates and associated molecular mechanisms that may be vulnerable to shifts in ocean chemistry.

- [Figure 2](https://github.com/yaaminiv/paper-oa-reproduction-review/blob/main/metadata/2-metadata/Multipanel-Plot.pdf): Graphical description of studies used in this review. a) Geographic study locations (from left to right): Eastern Indo-Pacific, Temperate Northern Pacific, Temperate Northern Atlantic, Tropical Atlantic, Southern Ocean, Temperate Southern Africa, Arctic, Central Indo-Pacific, and Temperate Australasia. If organisms were collected from a different marine realm than where the experiment took place, only the collection location was considered. ie charts represent the proportion of taxa-specific studies conducted in each region, and numbers underneath the pies represent the total number of studies in that region. b) Cumulative number of papers published for each taxa from 2004 to 2020. An additional echinoderm study was published in 1924. c) Number of positive (black), neutral (dark grey), or negative (light grey) OA effects for various reproductive processes by taxa (from left to right: cnidarians, crustaceans, echinoderms, molluscs). The total number of studies for a reproductive process are included in each panel.
